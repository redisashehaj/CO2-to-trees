## A short and not boring introduction to this project

In this project I am building a web application in which a user will input several data (estimated) about how much he commutes/travels in a weekly/yearly basis. 
With this given data, I will be calculating the amount of CO2 he emits per year and give him an estimated amout of trees he should plant in order to compensate for the *"damage"*.
